//Strings are texts, which are under single , double, back-tick quote. 
//To declare a string, we need a variable name, assignment operator, a value under a single quote, double quote, or backtick quote. Let's see some 
//examples of strings:

// let space = ' '           // an empty space string
// let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
// let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
// let country = 'Finland'
// let city = 'Helsinki'
// let language = 'JavaScript'
// let job = 'teacher'
// let quote = "The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020."
// let quotWithBackTick = `The saying,'Seeing is Believing' is not correct in 2020.`

//String concatenation

//Connecting two or more strings together is called concatenation. Using the ///strings declared in the previous String section:

// let fullName = firstName + space + lastName; // concatenation, merging two string together.
// console.log(fullName);

// We can concatenate strings in different ways.

// Concatenating Using Addition Operator
// Concatenating using the addition operator is an old way. This way of concatenating is tedious and error-prone. It is good to know how to concatenate this way, but I strongly suggest to use the ES6 template strings (explained later on).

// Declaring different variables of different data types
let space = ' '
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let age = 250


let fullName =firstName + space + lastName
let personInfoOne = fullName + '. I am ' + age + '. I live in ' + country; // ES5 string addition

console.log(country)

//Long Literal Strings
// A string could be a single character or paragraph or a page. If the string length is too big it does not fit in one line. We can use the backslash character (\) at the end of each line to indicate that the string will continue on the next line. Example:

const paragraph = "My name is Asabeneh Yetayeh. I live in Finland, Helsinki.\
I am a teacher and I love teaching. I teach HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, \
Node.js, Python, Data Analysis and D3.js for anyone who is interested to learn. \
In the end of 2019, I was thinking to expand my teaching and to reach \
to global audience and I started a Python challenge from November 20 - December 19.\
It was one of the most rewarding and inspiring experience.\
Now, we are in 2020. I am enjoying preparing the 30DaysOfJavaScript challenge and \
I hope you are enjoying too."

console.log(paragraph)
